# Standards changelog

Append-only history of every change to `standards/*.md` files.
Format: each entry shows date, file, change, source episode (or "bootstrap"), reason.

Never edit existing entries. To revoke a rule, append a new entry that removes it with reason.

## 2026-04-27 — bootstrap
- Created standards/editing.md, captions.md, motion-graphics.md, audio.md, color.md, retro-changelog.md.
- Source: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-27-video-editing-studio-design.md.
- Reason: project bootstrap; rules captured during brainstorming session.

## 2026-04-27 — standards/audio.md voice/music level revision
- Voice target: −16 LUFS → **−14 LUFS** integrated.
- Music level: −22 LUFS → **−20 LUFS** (kept "6 dB below voice"; preserves the relative gap after the voice bump).
- Source: bootstrap (user-driven adjustment immediately after Phase 1 standards seeding).
- Reason: louder voice target better fits social-media playback norms (YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Reels) where -14 LUFS is the de-facto delivery level. Music kept exactly 6 dB below voice for consistent perceived balance.

## 2026-04-27 — Phase 2 verification observations (no standards change)
- Phase 2 plan Task 7 deferred: visual grade review requires spec-compliant raw footage (≥1440×2560 Rec.709 SDR). The verification clip was 1080×1920, which the pipeline upscaled to spec but is not representative for grade tuning.
- `tools/compositor/grade.json` defaults (saturation +8%, contrast +12%, vignette PI/4 @ 0.25) carried into Phase 3 unchanged; first real episode will revisit.
- Pipeline correctness end-to-end (CP1 + CP2) verified on the upscaled clip: Scribe transcription succeeded, claude subagent authored a valid edl.json, render produced 1440×2560 60 fps Rec.709 SDR studio-range master.mp4 at 34.7 Mbps with AAC 48 kHz stereo 320 kbps.
- Render bug caught and fixed during verification: ffmpeg `eq` filter inside the grade chain was emitting `yuvj420p` (full-range PC) instead of studio-range `yuv420p`. Added explicit `format=yuv420p,setparams=range=tv` to the filter chain and a regression assertion in `test-run-stage1.sh`.

## 2026-04-27 — Phase 3 HyperFrames CLI reality check (no standards change)
- Phase 3 plan was written before HyperFrames was inspected. Smoke test against `hyperframes@0.4.31` (npm, published 2026-04-26) found significant divergences from the plan's assumed CLI surface. Plan is NOT being rewritten; downstream tasks (composer, run-stage2.sh, render-final.sh) adapt on the fly to the real tool.
- Concrete divergences captured in `docs/notes/hyperframes-cli.md`:
  - Config file is `hyperframes.json`, not `hyperframes.config.json`.
  - `render` takes a positional `[DIR]` (with `index.html` as the root composition); no `--input`, `--width`, `--height`, or `--transparent` flags exist.
  - Resolution is set on the root composition's `data-width` / `data-height` attributes, not via CLI.
  - Transparency comes from `--format mov` or `--format webm`, not `--transparent`.
  - Real render flags: `-o`, `-f {24,30,60}`, `-q {draft,standard,high}`, `--format`, `-w`, `--docker`, `--hdr`, `--crf`, `--video-bitrate`, `--gpu`, `--strict[-all]`.
  - HyperFrames composition HTML requires `data-composition-id`, `data-start`, `data-duration`, `data-track-index`, and `class="clip"` on timed elements; videos must be `muted`; GSAP timelines must be paused and registered on `window.__timelines[id]` because the runtime drives time, not the page.
  - `add <name>` installs a registry **block** (→ `compositions/`) or **component** (→ `compositions/components/`), not a single component dir; it does not modify `index.html` — wiring the include snippet is on us.
- Determinism: `--docker` is the only bit-deterministic mode. Docker not installed on this machine; `npx hyperframes doctor` flags it. Local mode accepted for now; revisit if cross-machine reproducibility becomes a requirement.
- HyperFrames installs its own `chrome-headless-shell` (~101 MB, one-off) into `~/.cache/hyperframes/chrome/` on first render. Telemetry is on by default; not disabled (no user requirement).
- Adapted approach for Phase 3:
  1. Composer writes `index.html` (not `composition.html`) directly into `episodes/<slug>/stage-2-composite/`, with `data-width=1440 data-height=2560` on the root and properly-attributed timed elements per HyperFrames conventions.
  2. `run-stage2.sh` invokes `npx hyperframes lint --json` then `npx hyperframes render <stage-2-composite-dir> -f 60 --format mp4 -q high -o preview.mp4`.
  3. `render-final.sh` renders overlays as `--format mov` (alpha) and ffmpeg overlays + master + music sidecar (mix stays our responsibility — HyperFrames only emits visual + composition-internal audio).

## 2026-04-27 — pipeline pre-flight: tool update check (workflow change)
- New requirement (user): before working on a new episode, the pipeline must check for updates to fast-moving dependencies (HyperFrames in particular — published version 0.4.31 the day this phase started).
- Action: add a `tools/scripts/check-updates.sh` invoked by `new-episode.sh` as a non-blocking warning. Checks `npm view hyperframes version` against installed version (and vendored `video-use` SHA against upstream). Surfaces a notice; does not auto-upgrade.
- Reason: HyperFrames is brand-new (0.x) and shipping rapidly; running a stale version risks API drift between episodes. Same risk pattern likely applies to other vendored AI tooling.

## 2026-04-27 — Phase 3 audio mix bug fix in render-final.sh (no standards change)
- Bug: `tools/scripts/render-final.sh` mixed music with `amix weights=1 0.5` after `loudnorm=I=-20`, double-attenuating the music to ~-26 LUFS in the final mix instead of the -20 LUFS demanded by `standards/audio.md`. Originated from incorrect interpretation in the Task 12 brief — the standard already bakes the 6 dB voice/music gap into the absolute LUFS targets (voice -14, music -20), so no additional weight reduction is required.
- Fix: `weights=1 1`. Music sits at -20 LUFS post-loudnorm; voice arrives at -14 LUFS from upstream master. `test-render-final.sh` re-run, passes.
- Audit also confirmed: standards files do NOT conflict with HyperFrames CLI reality. They describe outputs and rules, not tool choice; no edit needed.
- Outstanding gap (defer to Phase 4): voice -14 LUFS target in `standards/audio.md` is asserted but never enforced in our pipeline — we trust video-use's master.mp4 to already be at -14 LUFS. If the first real episode's master deviates, add a voice loudnorm pass to `render-final.sh`.
